# C++ exercises

Quick C++ scripts I wrote to learn the language. These are not school exercises or anything, I just keep them around so I can one day look back at and laugh at them. Feel free to copy pasta any code you need, though be warned: bugs galore!

| 20/04/2019 | windows-keylogger.cpp  | A simple keylogger that'll work on most versions of Windows. It is in no way stealthy or properly optimized since the program just cycles through a bunch of given keys continiously, but it was a good exercise in working with strings and char's. If I were to build a real keylogger it shoud probably be event driven and log stuff to an external server instead of a local file. |
