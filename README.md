# C++ exercises

Quick C++ scripts I wrote to learn the language. These are not school exercises or anything, I just keep them around so I can one day look back at and laugh at them. Feel free to copy pasta any code you need, though be warned: bugs galore!

| Date | C++ file  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 20/04/2019 | windows-keylogger.cpp  | A simple keylogger that'll work on most versions of Windows. It is in no way stealthy or properly optimized since the program just cycles through a bunch of given keys continiously. A real keylogger it shoud probably be event driven. |
| 08/05/2019 | dead-pixel.cpp  | Harmless little script that uses the windows SetPixel API call to turn a random pixel on the screen red every 350 ms. |
