| Date | C++ file  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 20/04/2019 | windows-keylogger.cpp  | A simple keylogger program that'll work on most versions of Windows. It is in no way stealthy or properly optimized since the program just cycles through a bunch of given keys continiously. |
| 08/05/2019 | dead-pixel.cpp  | Harmless little program that uses the Windows SetPixel API call to turn a random pixel on the screen red every 350 ms. |
| 18/05/2019 | multi-thread.cpp  | Very simple program that uses two threads to print a 'hello world' message, this was just a simple test to figure out how multithreading works. |
| 18/05/2019 | socket-server.cpp  | A simple server program that uses TCP/IP sockets and (Windows) multithreading to send and recieve messages to/from a client application. |
